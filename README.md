Case Study - RR Diner Coffee


In this case study, I used sci-kit learn to build four different decision tree models — two using entropy and two using gini impurity — to ascertain whether a potentially business-transforming deal
with a mysterious coffee farm in China will take your business to the next level. 

The case study involves the use of the full data science pipeline, from importing, loading, and cleaning the data right through to modeling and concluding. In the case study, our decision trees will properly implement the supervised learning method of classification, and you will enforce the best practices of:

-making an appropriate train/test split
-one-hot encoding
-model evaluation
-restricting the maximum depth of the tree
-using the random forest to increase predictive accuracy and control overfitting
